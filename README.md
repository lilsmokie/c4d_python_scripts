#### [Color Swatch to Multi Shader](https://github.com/lilsmokie/c4d_python_scripts/blob/af5dff3a3a216778e11f8aafafd149c0c4877d0c/colorSwatchtoMultiShader/colorSwatchtoMultiShader_v002.py)

Creating and adjusting multishaders in C4D is time consuming.
Here's a script I wrote to make it easy.

1. Make sure you have a color swatch in the first slot
2. Run the script 
3. New material is created with your multishader
